> # ToDoApp_No1

> This is my first app created with Node.js. It is a To-do App that is created following the MVC pattern. The funcionality of the app is based on adding and removing tasks. The user just type the task and by clickin "Add Item" it will display as a pending task in the browser.

> To delete a task, just click on it and it's all.

>  ### Made with..

> - Node.js
> - Express
> - MongoDB (In order to store the tasks in a database)
> - EJS (Template to the user interface)
